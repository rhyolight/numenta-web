In the ***Brain Science Podcast***, [Dr. Ginger Campbell](http://www.virginiacampbellmd.com/ginger-campbell-md/) interviews leading scientists and shares recent discoveries from the world of neuroscience. The podcast first aired in 2006 and was in part inspired by Jeff’s book, [On Intelligence](https://numenta.com/papers-videos-and-more/resources/on-intelligence/). Jeff was [previously featured](http://brainsciencepodcast.com/bsp/interview-with-jeff-hawkins-on-intelligence-bsp-38.html?rq=jeff%20hawkins) in the ***Brain Science Podcast*** when Numenta first started in 2008 and was invited for another interview in 2017 to talk about the progress on our work. In this episode, Jeff describes theories from two of our peer-reviewed papers published on Frontiers in Neural Circuits:
* [Why Neurons Have Thousands of Synapses, A Theory of Sequence Memory in the Neocortex](https://numenta.com/papers/why-neurons-have-thousands-of-synapses-theory-of-sequence-memory-in-neocortex/) (2016)
* [A Theory of How Columns in the Neocortex Enable Learning the Structure of the World](https://numenta.com/papers/a-theory-of-how-columns-in-the-neocortex-enable-learning-the-structure-of-the-world/) (2017)
