Podcast host Christy Maver interviews Francisco Weber, CEO and Co-founder of Cortical.io. Cortical.io is a strategic partner of Numenta that specializes in natural language understanding. In this episode, Francisco talks about the spark that started it all for him while watching a YouTube video of our Co-founder, Jeff Hawkins, the advantages of their patented semantic folding methodology over other machine learning, statistical-based approaches, and the many natural language use cases the company addresses.

## Show Notes

For educational material regarding the topics discussed in this podcast episode, you have a few options. If you want to be fed the theory, watch [HTM School](https://numenta.org/htm-school/). If you need more details, there are [many papers to explore](/neuroscience-research/research-publications/papers/). If you want to talk to others about HTM theory, get involved in our [community](https://discourse.numenta.org/). For a primer on grid cells, have a look at this [interactive blog post](/blog/2018/05/25/how-grid-cells-map-space/). For more on how we think grid cells work within the neocortex, watch Jeff’s recent talk, [Does the Neocortex Use Grid Cell-Like Mechanisms to Learn the Structure of Objects?](/resources/videos/jeff-hawkins-simons-institute-talk/)
