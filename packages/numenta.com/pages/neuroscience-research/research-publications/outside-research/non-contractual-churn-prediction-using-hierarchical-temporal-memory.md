description: "In this Master's thesis from the University of Agder, the authors examine using Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) to predict future purchase
events of customers in a non-contractual setting. HTM was chosen specifically because of a desire to research algorithms that may be useful in churn analysis by utilizing temporal structure of data in prediction based models. The authors also compare HTM results to other techniques. "
