description: "This paper describes a cortical model for untangling sensorimotor from external sequences. It shows how a single neural mechanism can learn and recognize these two types of sequences: sequences where sensory inputs change due to external factors, and sequences where inputs change due to our own behavior (sensorimotor sequences)."
